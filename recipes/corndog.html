    <h1>Corn dogs recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/corndog.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> A corn dog (also spelled corndog) is a sausage (usually a hot dog) on a stick that has been 
        coated in a thick layer of cornmeal batter and deep fried. It originated in the United States 
        and is commonly found in American cuisine. 
    </p>

    <p> Corn dogs are often served as street food or as fast food. For the best and freshest preparation, 
        some vendors or restaurateurs dip and fry their corn dogs just before serving.
        Some corn dog purveyors sell pre-made frozen corn dogs, which have been thawed and then fried again or browned in an oven. 
    </p>

    <p> Corn dogs can also be found at almost any supermarket and convenience store store in North 
        America as frozen foods as well as served hot and ready to eat. Pre-made frozen corn dogs can also be 
        heated in a microwave oven, but the cornbread coating will lack texture.
